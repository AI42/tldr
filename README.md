### What?
tldr is a golang package to summarize a text automatically using [lexrank](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume22/erkan04a-html/erkan04a.html) algorithm.

### How?
There are two main steps in lexrank, weighing, and ranking. tldr have three weighing and two ranking algorithm included, they are Jaccard coeficient, Hamming distance, and PageRank, centrality, respectively. The default settings use Hamming distance and centrality.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"github.com/JesusIslam/tldr"

func main() {
	intoSentences := 3
	textB, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("./sample.txt")
	text := string(textB)
	bag := tldr.New()
	result := bag.Summarize(text, intoSentences)
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```
